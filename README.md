# HU-CONNECT Community based platform
## HU Connect — Bridge the Knowledge Gap at Haramaya University

**HU Connect** helps first‑year students quickly find trustworthy answers to university life. Instead of getting lost in scattered chats or outdated PDFs, freshers can ask questions and get guidance directly from experienced students who’ve been there — about departments, courses, campus life, and even side hustles.

### The problem
- **Freshers feel lost**: info is scattered, unclear, or outdated.
- **Hard to find the right mentor**: not everyone knows who to ask.
- **Wasted time and wrong advice**: leads to confusion and poor decisions.

### The solution
- **Ask anything, get peer‑verified answers** from seniors and experienced students.
- **Tag questions by department/topic** to reach the right people faster.
- **Vote and accept answers** so the most helpful guidance rises to the top.
- **Stay in the loop with notifications** when your question gets answers or updates.

### Who it’s for
- **Freshers**: fast, reliable guidance.
- **Seniors/Mentors**: pay it forward and build community.
- **Clubs/Communities**: share accurate, centralized info.

### Impact
- **Faster onboarding**, **fewer mistakes**, and a **more supportive campus** for everyone.
