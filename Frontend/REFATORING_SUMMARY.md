# HU Connect Frontend Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring work done to integrate the HU Connect frontend with the backend API using appropriate Next.js rendering strategies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)

- **Before**: Client-side rendered page that fetched questions on mount
- **After**: Server Component that fetches questions on the server using `getQuestions()` from `src/lib/data.ts`
- **Interactive Elements**: Search and sorting functionality moved to a separate Client Component (`DashboardClientComponent.tsx`)

### 2. Question Detail Page (`/questions/[id]`)

- **Before**: Client-side rendered page that fetched question details on mount
- **After**: Server Component that fetches question and answers on the server using `getQuestionById()` from `src/lib/data.ts`
- **Interactive Elements**: Voting, answering, and accepting answers functionality moved to a separate Client Component (`QuestionPageClientComponent.tsx`)

### 3. Profile Page (`/profile`)

- **Status**: Remains as a Client Component as required
- **Reason**: Displays user-specific private data that requires client-side authentication

### 4. Notifications Page (`/notifications`)

- **Status**: Remains as a Client Component as required
- **Reason**: Displays user-specific private data that requires client-side authentication

### 5. Static & Interactive Pages

- **Login Page (`/`)**: Remains as a Client Component
- **Register Page (`/register`)**: Remains as a Client Component
- **Forgot Password Page (`/forgot-password`)**: Remains as a Client Component
- **Ask Question Page (`/questions/ask`)**: Remains as a Client Component
- **Reason**: These pages consist of interactive forms and do not require server-fetched data for initial display

## Key Implementation Details

### API Communication

- All data fetching continues to use the pre-configured Axios instance at `src/lib/axios.ts`
- The Axios instance handles the base URL via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable
- Authentication tokens are automatically attached to headers for client-side requests

### Rendering Strategy

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Used for pages that benefit from SEO and initial load performance (Dashboard, Question Details)
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Used for pages with private user data or purely interactive forms

### File Structure Changes

1. Created `Frontend/src/app/dashboard/DashboardClientComponent.tsx` for client-side interactivity
2. Created `Frontend/src/app/questions/[id]/QuestionPageClientComponent.tsx` for client-side interactivity
3. Modified `Frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to be a Server Component
4. Modified `Frontend/src/app/questions/[id]/page.tsx` to be a Server Component

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Performance**: Initial page loads for public content are faster due to server-side rendering
2. **Better SEO**: Search engines can now properly index question content
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users see content immediately without loading spinners on key pages
4. **Maintained Interactivity**: All client-side functionality (voting, answering, etc.) continues to work as expected
5. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns between server data fetching and client interactivity
